# InstaMedi
InstaMedi is a medical web application that aims to bridge the gap between patients and doctors in Uganda. It offers various services such as online appointments, medical consultations, online prescriptions, payment of bills, research resources, and many others. InstaMedi is entirely Ugandan and aims to solve Ugandaâ€™s medical service delivery problems using Uganda solutions, resources, and ideas.

## Motivation
The motivation behind InstaMedi is to deliver medical services to the civilians of Uganda at much cheaper costs, efficiently, and also eradicate some of the challenges the medical system of Uganda has not been able to put right. Some of these challenges include:

- Lack of access to quality and affordable health care, especially in rural areas
- Long waiting times and queues at health facilities
- Inadequate and outdated medical equipment and infrastructure
- Shortage of qualified and skilled health workers
- High prevalence of communicable and non-communicable diseases
- Low awareness and utilization of preventive and promotive health services

InstaMedi aims to address these challenges by providing a platform where patients can easily and conveniently connect with doctors, get diagnosis and treatment, pay for their services, and access reliable and relevant health information.

## Features
InstaMedi has the following features:
- Online appointment system, where users can book, cancel, or reschedule their appointments with doctors of their choice
- Medical consultation system, where users can chat, call, or video call with doctors, and get diagnosis and treatment advice
- Online prescription system, where doctors can prescribe medications to users, and users can order and pay for their medications online
- Content management system, where doctors can upload and update their content such as articles, videos, podcasts, or webinars on various health topics
- Research resources system, where users can access and download various health-related resources such as reports, journals, books, or newsletters
